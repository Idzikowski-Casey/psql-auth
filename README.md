# PSQL Authorization

### A conceptual model of how to handle permissions and privileges for web users in PostgreSQL

This repository consists of a postgreSQL db, a series of tests (with associated sql), and documentation on the sigificance of each test and the security princple being implemented and tested.

The concepts start out basic with general db roles and a single table with row level security. With each subsequent test file the complexity increases with the hopes of evolving to a robust user management system that can be applied across applications.
